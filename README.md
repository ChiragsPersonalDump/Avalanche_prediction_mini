This is a mini avalanche detection project 

Library dependencies : Numpy , pandas , seaborn , sklearn .

Data set : -> contains 5 features : Slope  ,forest density, Snow Density , Air Temperature,  Wind 
               -> A total of 204 examples are contained in data set.
                # some features might have been scaled down or encoded .
                
Model : sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier is used for making prediction's 

Predictions : model makes predictions as 0,1 or 2 which means low risk , medium risk and high risk respectively.

# model makes accurate predictions of 92%.
# no feature scaling is used as of such.
